"""Generic client for a service's Unix-domain-socket "feed" (see
drive/feed.py's DriveFeedServer, oxts-nav/nav_feed.py's NavFeedServer for
the server side): connects, reads the 4-byte-big-endian-length-prefixed
pickled-dict framing, and reconnects automatically (1s backoff) if the
owning service hasn't started yet or restarts.

First built as aruco's own nav_client.py (the first consumer of
nav_feed.py); promoted here once navigate needed the same thing for both
oxts-nav's and drive's feeds — see the shared-asset-promotion convention
in ui-style.md ("build where first needed, promote once a second consumer
needs it").
